# TuneHoarder — Gotchas

Non-obvious design decisions and known failure modes in TuneHoarder. If something looks "wrong," check here before "fixing" it.

## Do not call Spotify Audio Features

Spotify deprecated the `/audio-features` and `/audio-analysis` endpoints for all *new* apps in November 2024. If you're tempted to simplify `analyzer.py` by calling `sp.audio_features([id])` instead of running librosa, you'll get a 403 from any app created after the deprecation date.

This is why we do local analysis. Don't migrate back. If Spotify reverses the decision, we can add it as a fast-path *before* librosa — but the local analyzer stays as the fallback because it's source-of-truth for the file we actually downloaded (remixes, edits, and bootlegs won't match the Spotify track's features).

## Spotify response key: `item`, not `track`

In 2025 Spotify changed the `playlist_items` response shape. Per-entry track data used to live under `entry["track"]`; it now lives under `entry["item"]` (unifying tracks and podcast episodes under one key). `spotify_client.py:get_playlist_tracks` reads `entry.get("item") or entry.get("track")` so it tolerates both shapes.

If you see "0 tracks" on a playlist that clearly has items, and `sp.playlist()` returns metadata fine, this is almost certainly the culprit. Dump the raw `sp.playlist_items(pid, limit=1)` JSON and check whether `item` or `track` is populated. Do not restore `fields="items(track(...))"` in the spotipy call — that strict field selection throws away everything under `item` and reproduces the zero-tracks bug.

## ffmpeg is a system dependency, not a pip package

`yt-dlp` shells out to `ffmpeg` for the mp3 conversion postprocessor. If ffmpeg isn't on PATH, yt-dlp throws a confusing "ffprobe/ffmpeg not found" error during postprocessing — the file downloads fine but the mp3 conversion fails and no output is produced.

On Windows: `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`, then restart the terminal so PATH picks up the new entry. On macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`. On Linux: `apt install ffmpeg` or equivalent.

`pip install ffmpeg-python` does NOT install the binary — it's just a Python wrapper that still requires the native ffmpeg. Do not add it to requirements.txt.

## Windows stdout defaults to cp1252

Windows Python opens `sys.stdout` with the system codepage (cp1252 for most installs), which can't encode most unicode track titles or even the `→` character used in progress output. `main.py` reconfigures both `stdout` and `stderr` to UTF-8 at import time. Do not remove this — it is the *only* reason the script doesn't crash on playlists with non-ASCII artist names. If you see a `UnicodeEncodeError` during printing, confirm that reconfigure block is still present.

Setting `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` in the environment works too but isn't portable — code-level reconfigure is the reliable fix.

## CSV writes must be atomic

`main.py` writes `index.csv.tmp` then `replace()`s it onto `index.csv`. Earlier versions opened `index.csv` directly in `"w"` mode (truncating immediately) and sorted inline during the write loop — a `TypeError` in the sort comparator left us with a header-only file and 182 orphaned MP3s. The atomic pattern means even a mid-write crash leaves the prior CSV intact.

Don't "simplify" this back to a direct write. The cost (one extra rename) is nothing; the failure mode (destroy 30+ minutes of download work) is everything.

Corollary: `--skip-existing` falls back to reconstructing rows from MP3 ID3 tags if `index.csv` is missing or has no data rows. This is load-bearing recovery logic, not an optimization. If you change the tagging scheme (what goes in `TBPM`/`TKEY`), update `reconstruct_row_from_disk()` to match.

## Windows antivirus can lock freshly-written MP3s

`main.py:safe_replace()` wraps `os.replace()` in a retry loop (6 attempts, 0.5s apart). Windows Defender or the Search Indexer sometimes holds a transient exclusive lock on a freshly-written file for a few hundred ms while it scans/indexes. Without the retry, `os.replace()` raises `PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access denied` on random tracks — roughly one in every 50-200 files in our testing.

This is not the same as a true permission error (read-only file, ACL issue). Genuine errors fail after all retries. Do not catch broader exception types; the retry is targeted at this specific transient race.

## Krumhansl key detection accuracy is capped

`analyzer.py` uses Krumhansl-Schmuckler key profiles correlated against the mean chroma. Published benchmarks on this algorithm hit ~80–85% on pop/rock corpora. Failures concentrate in:

- **Bass-heavy electronic music** — low-frequency harmonics bleed across chroma bins and bias the root.
- **Modal tracks** (Dorian, Phrygian) — get forced into major or minor.
- **V-chord-heavy tracks** — classified as the dominant instead of the tonic (e.g., a C major track with lots of G chords gets called G major).
- **Very short tracks** — we only analyze the first 120 seconds; if the intro is atonal or in a different key, the whole track gets misclassified.

**Do not** try to "fix" wrong keys by tweaking the profile weights — that's whack-a-mole. If accuracy matters, the real upgrades are:

1. `essentia`'s `KeyExtractor` with the `edma` profile (~90%+ but painful to install on Windows — requires MSVC and is not officially pip-shipped for modern Python on Win).
2. A paid API (GetSongBPM free tier, Tunebat scraping, etc.) — covers mainstream well, misses underground.
3. Mixed In Key desktop app (gold standard, paid, manual workflow).

## BPM clamping to [85, 200] + start_bpm=150 is intentional

`analyzer.py:_detect_bpm()` passes `start_bpm=150` to librosa's beat tracker (overriding its default of 120) and clamps the result to `[85, 200]` — doubles anything under 85, halves anything over 200. Tuned for DJ electronic music including D&B and hardcore on the top end.

Why these specific numbers:

- `start_bpm=150` biases the autocorrelation pick toward DJ tempos. Default `start_bpm=120` systematically under-picks on D&B/fast-trap, reporting e.g. 83 BPM for a 166 BPM track (the autocorrelation has peaks at both 83 and 166, and ties go to whichever is closer to start_bpm).
- Clamp `[85, 200]`. The bounds are **non-overlapping**: doubling `< 85` caps at 170 (never triggers halve); halving `> 200` floors at 100 (never triggers double). This avoids an infinite loop you'd hit with bounds like `[90, 180]` where 90 doubles to 180, gets halved to 90, and oscillates.
- The upper bound was originally 170. That **wrongly halved genuine D&B and hardcore tracks** (user reported a 185 BPM track being destroyed). 200 is the right ceiling for house/techno/D&B/fast-trap libraries. Raise further only if the library includes breakcore / speedcore (200+ BPM).

The remaining tradeoff: genuine **sub-85 BPM tracks get wrongly doubled**. Boom-bap hip-hop at 75-85 BPM becomes 150-170. For those, the user edits `index.csv` manually and reruns with `--bucket-by-bpm` — the sync pass re-tags from the CSV. Alternatively, `--reanalyze` re-runs the detector on existing MP3s (useful after tuning the algorithm itself).

Do not widen the clamp without re-deriving the non-overlap guarantee. Specifically: `lower * 2 ≤ upper` AND `upper / 2 ≥ lower` must both hold. A single infinite loop in `_detect_bpm` hangs the whole run silently — there's no timeout.

## Rekordbox reads `TKEY` as-is

Rekordbox displays whatever string is in the `TKEY` ID3 frame in its Key column, unmodified. We put Camelot notation there directly (`"8A"`, `"12B"`). This is why `tagger.py` writes Camelot to `TKEY` — *not* to a custom `TXXX:KEY` user-defined frame or to the comment.

Other DJ software is different:

- **Traktor** — reads `TKEY` but defaults to displaying musical notation. Users can toggle to Camelot in prefs. If targeting Traktor, consider writing musical notation (`"Am"`) and letting the user opt into Camelot display.
- **Serato** — reads `TKEY` but will overwrite it with its own analysis on first import unless you disable "Auto Detect Key."
- **Engine DJ / Prime** — reads `TKEY` but prefers the Mixed In Key format variant (`"8A"` works).

If you generalize to multiple targets, add a `--key-format` flag rather than changing the default.

## Auth: OAuth user flow, not Client Credentials

`spotify_client.py` uses `SpotifyOAuth` with scopes `playlist-read-private playlist-read-collaborative`. This was **not** the original design — we started with `SpotifyClientCredentials` (app-level auth, no user login), but discovered in 2025 that Spotify tightened Client Credentials access to the `playlist_items` endpoint. Symptom: `sp.playlist(id)` returns metadata fine (including `public: True`), but `sp.playlist_items(id)` returns **401 "Valid user authentication required"** — even on public user-owned playlists. This happened to us with a public playlist owned by a different user.

Adding `market='US'` does not help. The fix is OAuth user flow, which we now use.

What works with OAuth:

- Public and private user-created playlists (owned by the authenticated user or anyone else)
- Collaborative playlists
- "Liked Songs" (via `sp.current_user_saved_tracks()` — not wired up yet)

What still **does not** work:

- **Spotify-curated editorial / algorithmic playlists** (IDs starting with `37i9dQZF1...`) — these return **404** as of November 2024. OAuth does not unlock these; they're a separate "extended access" tier that requires a manual application to Spotify. Workaround: the user duplicates the editorial playlist into a personal playlist (Spotify UI → `...` → Add to playlist → New playlist) and passes that URL instead.

First-run UX: opens the default browser to `accounts.spotify.com/authorize`, user clicks "Agree", Spotify redirects to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` where spotipy's tiny local server catches the code. The token is cached to `.spotify_cache` in the project root (gitignored) and reused on subsequent runs — no more browser popups until the refresh token expires (~months).

The redirect URI is hardcoded in `spotify_client.py:get_playlist_tracks`. It must exactly match one registered in the Spotify app dashboard. Spotify stopped accepting `localhost` in 2025 — use the literal IP `127.0.0.1`.

## The sanitized filename limit is 120 chars

`main.py:safe_filename()` truncates to 120 chars. Windows' MAX_PATH is 260 and the full path includes the output directory, so a 120-char filename leaves room for a reasonable nested path. Don't raise it without checking the longest realistic output path.

## CSV Camelot sort is lexicographic

`main.py` sorts the CSV rows by `str(camelot)`. This puts `"10A"` before `"1A"` (lexicographic "10" < "1A" is false — actually `"10A" > "1A"` lexicographically because `"0" < "A"`). So the sort is *stable and unique* but not musically ordered.

If the user wants wheel-order sort (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, ...), parse to `(int(num), letter)` before sorting. We haven't done this because the CSV is typically loaded into the DJ app which re-sorts by its own rules.

## The dev environment is Windows 11

All paths use `pathlib`, but shell examples in docs assume bash-on-Windows conventions (forward slashes, `python` on PATH). If running on Linux/macOS, the only real difference is `ffmpeg` installation. No code changes needed.
